# Progress

Living project doc. Read it before you start; update it with every push.

## Plan

**Idea:** a customer hires our agent on Sokosumi with a conditional job, e.g. "if ETH < $3000, execute the vault action". The ADA payment sits in Masumi escrow.

1. Agent receives the job (Masumi/Sokosumi, Cardano preprod).
2. Agent fetches a signed ETH/USD response from API3 AirnodeHub.
3. Agent submits the signed response to our vault contract on an EVM testnet.
4. The contract checks signer, request id, freshness and replay, then acts or refuses.
5. Agent returns the EVM tx hash as the job result and escrow releases the ADA.

**Tracks**
- Cardano "Agentic Commerce": at least 1 paid job on preprod, keep the tx hash. Video: customer, problem, business model, full paid job.
- API3 "Any API in your contract": contract verifies AirnodeHub signed data. Tamper-test video (modified value, stale, other request, wrong key). Judges can submit their own responses via a script.
- TUM track: audit credit, automatic.

**Who does what**
- Cardano payments: Masumi agent, Sokosumi listing, escrow, preprod tx hashes.
- API3 contract: Foundry vault, verification, tamper tests, submit script.
- Video / presentation.

## Interfaces

**Cardano agent to EVM script**
- The agent runs `api3/scripts/agent-run.sh` with `THRESHOLD_USD` set (from the job input `threshold_usd`).
- The last stdout line is JSON: `txHash`, `price`, `executed`, `chainId`, `vault`, `orderId`. The agent returns it as the job result.

**Vault contract** (`api3/src/PriceTriggeredVault.sol`, details in `api3/README.md`)

```solidity
function submitAndTryExecute(
    uint256 orderId,
    bytes32 requestHash,  // AirnodeHub request hash, must be the ETH/USD request
    uint256 timestamp,    // signed timestamp, max 300 s old
    bytes   data,         // exact signed response body, e.g. {"ethereum":{"usd":2987.41}}
    bytes   signature     // must come from the configured airnode
) external returns (uint256 price, bool executed);
```

Reverts on wrong signer, other request, stale or future timestamp, replayed or older response, edited data. `executed=false` means the price was valid but the condition was not met. `agent-run.sh` creates the order and calls this.

## Rules
- Add a log entry below with every push (newest on top).
- No secrets in git (Blockfrost key, private keys, mnemonics). Use `.env`.

- Notes: (tx hashes, addresses, blockers)
```

### 2026-10-30 · Orhun
- Changed: API3: added `api3/`, a Foundry vault that verifies AirnodeHub signed ETH/USD (signer, request hash, freshness, no replay) and pays out when the price crosses the threshold. 15 tests incl. all tamper cases; `scripts/local-demo.sh` runs the full flow on anvil. `scripts/submit.sh` for judges (tamper modes: value, stale, request, key), `scripts/agent-run.sh` for the Cardano agent.
- Next: fetch a real AirnodeHub response, deploy to Base Sepolia (steps in `api3/README.md`), set `VAULT_ADDRESS` for the agent. Confirm the signing format at the API3 workshop.

### 2026-10-30 · Orhun
- Changed: Cardano: added `cardano-agent/`, a Masumi seller agent (input `threshold_usd`) that runs `api3/scripts/agent-run.sh` after escrow payment and returns the EVM tx hash. `buy_job.py` pays on preprod and saves Cardano tx hashes to `cardano-agent/proofs/`.
- Next: Blockfrost preprod key, Masumi quickstart (Docker), faucet tADA, one paid job.

### 2026-10-30 · Orhun
- Changed: project doc with plan, interfaces and this log; optional pre-push reminder.
- Next: API3: Foundry starter and vault contract draft.
- Notes: turn the reminder on with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
